<h1>The Best Movies According to Stephanie</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Lucifer</h3>
<p>I love this movie because I felt so connected to the main character.<br/>
It also made me reflect deeply about myself and;<br/>
generally it had a great impact on my way of seeing things.<br/></p>

<h3>Vampire Diaries</h3>
<p>I just love everything about the movie especially Damon.<br/>
Vampire diaries made me a bit emotional but i still enjoyed the movie.<br/>
Damon most especially was my favorite character in The Vampire Diaries series </p>

<h3>Sex Education</h3>
<p>It had a lot of sex scenes so I really enjoyed it.<br>Just joking. It had a lot of LGBTQIA+ characters and I'm not trying to be judgy or anything but I can get really homophobic most times so yeah.<br/> Movie was still nice though.</p>
